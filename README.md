## Overview
An addition to Apples Sprite Kit frame work for iOS which allows for the creation of tilemaps either programmatically or from a .tmx file (created in [Tiled](www.mapeditor.org)). SKTilemap is written purely in Swift and sets out to be a simple solution for all game programmers alike to add tilemaps to thier Sprite Kit games.

## Why
I decided to write this because I couldn't find a good alternative written purely in Swift. I'm also a self taught programmer and this was a good learning exercise. I've tried to document the code as well as I can so it shouldn't be to hard to look through it and add features or change anything you want.

## Requirements
* Xcode 7.3
* Swift 2

## Usage
Simply add the SKTilemap*.swift files to your project and you're good to go.

*In the future I will combine all of the files into a single file. For now while I'm still working on the project it's just easier to keep the classes seperate.*

### Loading a Tilemap from a .tmx
To load a tilemap from a .tmx file simply add the .tmx to your project (plus the associated images for your tiles) and use:
    
    if let tilemap = SKTilemap.loadTMX(name: "awsome_map_made_in_Tiled") { }
    
Once the tilemap has been successfully loaded you can treat it as a normal SKNode. It's always best to load the tilemap within an **if let** or **guard let** statement because the loading *can* fail.

## Tutorials
Coming soon...

## Quick Guide
Here's a quick overview of the API which should hopefully be self explanatory. I have tried to document everything in code as best I can if you get stuck.

### Tilemap Layers
Layers are also SKNode objects and can be added to an SKTilemap object. Each layer contains many SKTile objects (as children) that make up the visual look for that layer.

**Adding, Getting and Removing Layers**

    tilemap.getLayer(name: "Tile Layer 1")
    tilemap.add(tileLayer: someLayer)
    tilemap.add(tileLayer: someLayer, zPosition: 1000)
    tilemap.removeLayer(name: "Tile Layer 87")
    
**Adding, Getting and Removing Tiles from a Layer**

    layer.tileAt(x: 3, y 3)
    layer.tileAt(position: CGPoint(x: 3,y: 3))
    layer.setTileAt(x: 3, y: 3, tile: aTile)
    layer.setTileAt(x: 3, y: 3, id: 90)
    layer.removeTile(x: 3, y: 3)
    layer.removeAllTiles()
    
**Tile Coordinates & Positioning**

    layer.tilePositionAt(x: 3, y: 3)
    layer.coordAtPosition(position: CGPoint)
    layer.coordAtTouchPosition(UITouch)
    
### Object Groups
Will probably only be used if loading from a .tmx file.

**Adding and Getting Object Groups**

    tilemap.add(objectGroup: AnObjectGroup)
    tilemap.getObjectGroup(name: "Some Object Group")
    
**Adding and Getting Objects**
    
    objectGroup.addObject(SomeObject)
    objectGroup.getObject(id: 5)
    objectGroup.getObjects(name: "Gold Coin")
    objectGroup.getObjects(type: "enemy")
    
### Tilesets
Tilesets are a collection of SKTileData objects. SKTileData objects act as a blueprint when creating individual tiles. Each SKTileData object has a unique ID number known as a GID (if you're familiar with Tiled).

**Adding and Getting Tilesets**
    
    tilemap.add(tileset: SKTileset)
    tilemap.getTileset(name: "coolest graphics eva")
    tilemap.getTileData(id: 54)
    
**Adding and Getting TileData**

    tileset.addTileData(spriteSheet: "a load of sheet sprites")
    tileset.addTileData(id: 90, texture: SKTexture)
    tileset.addTileData(id: 45, imageNamed: "Grass")
    tileset.getTileData(id: 45)

## TMX Support
I haven't yet implemented all of the features you can use to create a tilemap in [Tiled](www.mapeditor.org). Here's a quick list of what **is** and **isn't** yet implemented. I hope to support all features in the future, but feel free to fork this project and add anything yourself. I've tried to make this list as comprehensive as possible but no doubt there are many things I've missed.

### Supported
* Orientation (Orthogonal, Isometric)
* Tilesets (Separate Image, Sprite Sheet)
* Tile Layers
* Object Groups (Layers)
* Encoding (Base64, CSV, XML)
* Objects (Rectangular)
* Properties for all types (Map, Layer, Objects etc...)

### Not Supported
* Orientation (Isometric Staggered, Hexagonal)
* Tilesets (External)
* Image Layers
* Terrain Types
* Animated Tiles
* Compression (gzip, zlib)
* Tile Flipping
* Objects (Elipse, Polygon, Polyline)
